This library implements a subset-difference revocation scheme, like e.g. used
by AACS.

To compile the sdtree library, simply invoke make.
If you want to compile on OS X, you have to uncomment a line in the makefile.

To install invoke make install.

To change the library and include installation paths, please edit the paths directly in the makefile.

Gotchas:
If "fsadm" seems to hang after startup that usually means that there 
is not enough entropy available from /dev/random.

Please note that this was developed for a research project and never reviewed by cryptographers - 
do not use for anything where you actually need security.
